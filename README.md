# Image Classification Model

## Overview
The **Image Classification Model** is a machine learning project that automatically classifies images into predefined categories using **deep learning** techniques.  
It leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** or **pre-trained architectures** (like VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet) to learn visual features such as color, texture, and shape, enabling accurate image recognition.

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow ‚Äî from **data preprocessing** and **model training** to **evaluation** and **prediction visualization** ‚Äî providing a practical understanding of computer vision fundamentals.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Organize dataset into training, validation, and testing directories.  
   - Apply image preprocessing (resizing, normalization).  
   - Use data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming) to improve model generalization.

2. **Model Building**  
   - Define and compile a CNN or import a pre-trained model (Unet).  
   - Configure loss function, optimizer, and accuracy metrics.  
   - Train the model on the dataset and save weights for future inference.

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate the model using accuracy, loss curves, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - Visualize results with a **confusion matrix** and **sample predictions**.

4. **Prediction**  
   - Test the model on unseen images to predict their classes.  
   - Display images with predicted labels and confidence scores.
